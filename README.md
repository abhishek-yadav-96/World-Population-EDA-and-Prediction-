# World-Population-EDA-and-Prediction
This project analyzes global annual population data using Python's data science libraries. The dataset, "Global_annual_population.csv," is used to explore population trends over the years. The project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and builds a simple linear regression model to make predictions about future population trends.
